# 🧠 Consumer Complaint Analysis using NLP & Machine Learning

📅 **Period:** 2019–2024  
🧠 **Tech Stack:** Python | NLP | Machine Learning | Pandas | NLTK | Scikit-learn | Seaborn  

---

## 🎯 Objective
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of **U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** complaint data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.  
It identifies sentiment, complaint clusters, and potential fraud indicators from thousands of consumer narratives.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used
- **[CFPB Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/)**  
  Contains millions of real consumer complaint records about financial products and institutions across the United States.

---

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned and standardized complaint narratives.
   - Converted date columns into proper datetime format.
   - Sampled 20,000 rows for efficient analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Identified companies and states with highest fraud-related complaints.
   - Analyzed complaint trends, response times, and disputed cases.

3. **Sentiment Analysis (VADER)**
   - Used NLTK’s VADER to categorize complaints as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.
   - Visualized sentiment distribution to gauge consumer satisfaction.

4. **Topic Modeling (LDA)**
   - Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden complaint clusters.
   - Extracted major issues such as **credit report errors**, **debt collection**, and **unauthorized charges**.

5. **Fraud Detection (Machine Learning)**
   - Labeled fraud-related texts using keyword indicators.
   - Vectorized narratives with TF-IDF and trained a **Random Forest Classifier**.
   - Achieved **98% accuracy** and **ROC-AUC = 0.995** in fraud detection.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Top Fraud Companies:** Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, PayPal, Chase  
- **Fraud Hotspots:** California, Florida, Texas, New York  
- **Timely Response Rate:** 98.76% of companies responded within time  
- **Sentiment:** Over 60% of complaints expressed negative tone
